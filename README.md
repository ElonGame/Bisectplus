# Bisectplus Add-on
Bisect function called with a Plane object.
Resulting in an bisected object with 3 vertex groups for the bisectloop, sideA and sideB respectively.

Be aware that the selection of vertices on the object to be used matters, as bisect, which is used for the first step, only cuts what is selected. The add-on then proceeds and generates the vertex groups, based on the selection, can it be that the bisectionloop ends up not being a loop. This can be used as a non cut vertex group creation in case you want to only weight each side of the object. 

Use it for whatever purpose, provided you do not claim it as your own work and that you include a link to this site if redistributed.
